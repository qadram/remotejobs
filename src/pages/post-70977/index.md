Do you love computers? Do you prefer to spend three hours scripting some boring repetitive action than 30 minutes doing it manually? Would you like to work in your pajamas, from anywhere in Australia?Smith Software is a boutique engineering firm that provides remote talent to Silicon Valley companies. One of our clients has asked us to build a DevOps team to support them in their Australian operations, so we're looking for energetic people with the following skills:  - Googling StackOverflow- Googling ServerFault- Reading man pages- Rapidly figuring out that the reason why something broke in prod is because some dude maintaining an obscure python dependency decided to change its API without telling anyone- Finding issues like that before they hit prod- Not having an aneurysm when discovering that systemd configuration is in /usr/lib/systemd instead of /etc/systemd- Writing a bash for loop without having to google the syntax (just kidding, even we can barely do this)- Being polite to clients- Knowing the differences between TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, POP, PvP, PCP, Elemeno P, etc.- Being courageous enough to occasionally edit things in prod when necessary, but competent enough to not catastrophically break everything- Using vi or one of its descendantsNo education required, you don't even need to know how to spell! Okay, you need to know how to spell. But enthusiasm and linux wizardry will be accepted in lieu of formal education or work experience. Emacs fanboys will be accepted but forced to assimilate - if you think we're going to be installing emacs on our IoT nodes, you need to seriously reduce your LSD intake.  Basically, we're looking for anyone who types 'xargs' in their day-to-day life. If that sounds like you, hit us up! Salary depends on what we can convince the client to pay for you, but if you're good, it should be a lot. We mentioned that they're in Silicon Valley, right?
