Happy Cog is looking for a skilled Angular developer for a part time contract position to start immediately. This contract position will stretch to the end of the year with a possible extension and will be 30-35 hours per week. Weâre a growing international, interactive agency of 50 people based in Manhattan, New York with great clients (like Google, Airbnb, Twelve South, Etsy, The Associated Press, New York City, St. Regis, Columbia University, and WPP). We're growing quickly in Europe and are looking for assistance on some projects. We are OK with remote English speaking contractors anywhere in the world, with preference to someone in Europe. In general we would like someone who loves keeping up-to-date on the newest advancements in the field and can figure out when to start applying those advancements to client work. You should have experience with deep Angular (> version 4) and Typescript. Experience with GraphQL is a plus. You'll be treated like a member of the development team, working closely with our Head of Development of Europe. Youâll also be communicating directly with the client and with our project managers to understand the requirements and present your work. Your position will be fun, challenging, and interesting.
