We have a full-time customer success position available to work with our [Affilorama.com](http://www.affilorama.com) customers.Our new customer success representative will play a vital role in answering customer queries, providing guidance (and sometimes a little common sense) and generally making sure our members receive all the help and care we can give them.We're looking for someone with great (written) people skills, a fair amount of cleverness, the ability to Get Things Done, and a genuine desire to help the good people of the internet succeed.**You'll need:*** Excellent written English and a friendly manner in writing. You should be able to build a rapport with customers via email.* Common sense and the ability to "read between the lines" to understand what customers are concerned about.* Empathy and patience to deal with customers with different backgrounds and levels of technical ability. You'll be clear, patient and pleasant.* Meticulous attention to detail. Your spelling and grammar should be top notch.* Good time management skills. Since this can be a remote working position, you'll need to be organized, motivated, and (dare we say) a "self-starter".* Good internet research skills for digging up hard-to-find suppliers, and for sniffing around to make sure they're legit!* The ability to learn new software and systems. You'll be working with our customer support software and content management system, so it's good if you're a quick learner and not fazed by learning new tools.* To be familiar with how Affilorama works, and how to go about fixing common problems.* A background in affiliate/inbound marketing is highly desirable.**Neat things about working with us:*** Flexible hours* Work from home* Relaxed, ego-free, family-friendly work culture
