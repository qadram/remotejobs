As a  **Customer Success Engineer** you will be responsible to assess the nature of product or service issues and resolve support problems for customers and partners through support tickets, live chat, and occasional voice calls. Successful employees are willing to collaborate with other team members, able to meet deadlines, and excited to test new ideas, tools, and tactics. We are looking for motivators, go-getters, and ways to improve our processes, our products, and ourselves. As one of our Customer Success Engineers, you are our front line; when our customers think of how great Platform.sh is, they think of you.
